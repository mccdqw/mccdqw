Software Ethical Considerations
	1. Making sure that the software I produce does not directly copy the work of someone else.
	2. Know that the software that I produce can have implications on the security and safety of others in the real world, so I must make sure that their safety is my top priority.
	3. I must know that the software I produce for a certain company is only for that said company and I shall not share it with anyone outside the company.
